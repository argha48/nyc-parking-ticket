# nyc-parking-ticket

### Context

The NYC Department of Finance collects data on every parking ticket issued in NYC (~10M per year!). This data is made publicly available to aid in ticket resolution and to guide policymakers.


### Content

There are four files, covering Aug 2013-June 2017. The files are roughly organized by fiscal year (July 1 - June 30) with the exception of the initial dataset. The initial dataset also lacks 8 columns that are included in the other three datasets (although be warned that these additional data columns are used sparingly). See the dataset descriptions for exact details. Columns include information about the vehicle ticketed, the ticket issued, location, and time.


### Acknowledgements

Data was produced by NYC Department of Finance. All data is found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2018/pvqr-7yc4) with updates every third week of the month.


### Inspiration

* When are tickets most likely to be issued? Any seasonality?
* Where are tickets most commonly issued?
* What are the most common years and types of cars to be ticketed?
